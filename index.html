<p>This project uses a machine learning approaches to forecast Tennis match results (men and women) based on previous match statistics. Given two players and one of the 4 tennis major tournaments ( Australian Open,French Open - Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open), the provided application (user manual attached in the appendix) will return the player that is more likely to win the match. In contrast to other sports - i.e. Baseball - publicly available statistical data for tennis is scarce, indicating that not much data analytics has been applied in the world of Tennis. The majority of Tennis forecasts, such as betting odds are obtained purely from player ranking, and number of wins/losses. The novelty of the approach taken in this project, is that it does not depend on the official ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) player rankings or how many matches a player won or lost, but rather how they played. Instead, we look at more objective performance data (i.e. net points, unforced errors, serving percentages, serving direction, points won on the second serve...).</p>
<p>
	A fundamental component of this project is to determine which features should be passed-on to the learning algorithm that was used to train the forecaster. The initial data scraped from various online sources provided up to 1000 features. Using correlation techniques, the most relevant features are obtained. By virtue of its interpretability, a decision tree learning algorithm is the preferred choice for this project. The used features contained both nominal and categorical types. 
</p>
<p>
	The majority of the data was crowd charted - meaning that it contained plenty of inconsistencies and required intense preprocessing. Once the formatting was consisted, data from multiple sources was cross checked to reduce the number of errors. Using correlation equations the correlation of each attribute to the classifier is determined. The attributes that exceed a certain a correlation index threshold were selected and reexamined using the author's expertise in tennis to avoid post hoc fallacies (also know as post hoc ergo propter hoc). The learned hypothesis was tested on the major ongoing tournament during the development of this project, upon which its success is measured.

<li>Export Player Data Button: export the data that was used for each player to create the test instance as a CSV</li>
<li>Export Tree to PDF Button: export a image representation of the tree that was used for the prediction as a PDF</li>
<li>Status of Exporting: this field let you know if the file was exported</li>
</ol>

<b>*</b> You must enter a valid name for a player, otherwise the <b><i>Prediction Status label</i></b> will not let you perform a prediction. A list of the available players can be found <a href="http://example.com">here (set the link address)</a><br>
<b>**</b> The last part of the path will be your file name. <b>Do not</b> finish it up with the format (e.g. .pdf or .csv), the app will handle this automatically. An tree example can be seem <a href="https://github.com/guiklink/Tennis_Predictor_App/blob/master/Output/rafaXrogertree.pdf">here</a>. Players' data example can be seem <a href="https://github.com/guiklink/Tennis_Predictor_App/blob/master/Output/rafaXroger.csv">here</a>.<br>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
